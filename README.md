# foyer application


A simple application that uses

- DDD architecture
- Riverpod 2.0 for state management
- Freezed
- Isar for local database
- Flutter hooks
- Flutter Animate

Things to consider adding in the future

- Adding a location service that updates the theme in real time based on the location. (Wasn't necessary for the application.)
- Responsive/Adaptive design. Ideally I would like to change the UI if it's being used on a website or desktop.

Bugs

-There might be some bugs which I haven't looked noticed, so testing could be added, but the app was small and didn't require it.

If you have Flutter installed you can run the program, open up the main.dart file, type in "flutter run" and you should be good to go.


Here's the link to download the app to test things out.
