# foyer application


A simple application that uses

- DDD architecture
- Riverpod 2.0 for state management
- Freezed
- Isar for local database
- Flutter hooks

Things to consider adding in the future

- Adding a location service that updates the theme in real time based on the location. (Wasn't necessary for the application.)
