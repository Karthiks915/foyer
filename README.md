A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Foyer Application

- Isar Local Database
- DDD architecture
- Riverpod 2.0 for state management (Riverpod Generator)
- Flutter hooks
- Freezed for dataclass generation


The application is pretty simple and straightforward, it lets the user create unique themes for each location based on latitude and longitude.


Future Plans

- Location services that updates the theme immediately based on the data. Haven't added this because it wasn't necessary to the application.
